## MySQL Exercises

A set of exercises for getting familiar with making SQL queries on MySQL using a pre-populated databased called Sakila.

The **Sakila** sample database was initially developed by Mike Hillyer, a former member of the MySQL AB documentation team, and is intended to provide a standard schema that can be used for examples in books, tutorials, articles, samples, and so forth. The Sakila sample database also serves to highlight features of MySQL such as Views, Stored Procedures, and Triggers.
